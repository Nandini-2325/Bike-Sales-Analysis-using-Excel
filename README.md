# 📊 Excel Sales & Profit Analysis Projects

## 🔎 Project Overview
This repository showcases multiple Excel projects demonstrating my ability to **clean, analyze, categorize, and visualize sales data**. I worked with datasets containing sales transactions, customer demographics, product details, and financial metrics.  

Key activities include:  
- Calculating **Profit** and applying **formulas** with absolute and relative referencing  
- Summarizing with **Pivot Tables**  
- Visualizing data with **Stacked Column, Line, and Pie Charts**  

The goal was to turn raw data into **actionable insights** and **interactive summaries** to support decision-making.
